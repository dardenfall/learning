notes:
- AMD vs CommonJS

- strengths and weaknesses
- disagreement with a coworker
  find a situation when I was wrong and came around.  Maybe code reviews?
- design pattern course pluralsight
- steve smith plural sight OO course.  SOLID
- spend some time on atom dev env
- enhance an object with a new function
- class with prototype
- closures tests
- currying
- primitives
