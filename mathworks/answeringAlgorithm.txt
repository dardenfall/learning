Ask questions
Solve the problem with three sets of manual data 
optimize the manual steps
write the manual steps as psuedo code
replace the psuedocode with manual code   
optimize

book, figure out an algorithm:
------------------------------
1) examples: Write out specific examples of the problem, and see if you can figure out a general rule.
2) pattern matching: Consider what problems the algorithm is similar to, and  figure out if you can modify the solution to develop an algorithm for this problem.
3) simplify: change a constraint to see if you can fix it for that, then generalize the problem
