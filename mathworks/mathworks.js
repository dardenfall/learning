The hacker rank challenge questions were the following:
1. Given a List of Strings,
      return the words that can be typed only using one row of your keyboard.
      example: ["Hello", "Alaska", "Dad", "Peace"] => ["Alaska", "Dad"]
  done: 1 time, oneline.js


2. Given a List of Strings of operators and numbers,
determine the sum of the given expression. The numbers can be positive or negative
and the operators only have multiplication and division.


3. Given an array starting from 1 to 2^n, [1,2,3,4], transform the array
such that when you split the array in half, the left side goes on top of the
right, repeat this until the left side has a length of 1.
[1,2,3,4] => [1,2][3,4] => [1][3][2][4] => [1,3,2,4].
4. Given a graph of vertices and directed edges,
return all vertices in order that can visit all other vertices within 2 steps.
